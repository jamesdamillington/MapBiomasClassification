# MapBiomasClassification
Comparing different classifications of MapBiomas 2.3 data for use with CRAFTY. 

Reclassification of the original MapBiomas data is needed to work with our CRAFTY model. When used with aggregated (5km) map data as we are here, different classifications of the original classification can result in very different land cover areas. Here, we test different classifications.
